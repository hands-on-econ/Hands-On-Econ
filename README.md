# Getting Started

Hands-On Econ is hosted on Github, an extremely useful file-sharing platform.  Github can seem a little scary to start with but don't worry, this is the only Github page we have to worry about! The course is formatted as 'Jupyter Notebooks' with the .ipynb extension. These files are used because they are much more versatile than either just text files (.doc) or just Python/R files (.py/.r). Jupyter Notebooks (or 'notebooks') contain all of the code, all of the output from the code and all of the explanation for each week. They are essentially the entire course!!

Back to Github. Github is just *hosting* the course. We *access* the course through a dedicated platform for opening notebooks: NBViewer. 

Michaelmas: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hands-on-econ/Hands-On-Econ/tree/master/Michaelmas/

Lent: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hands-on-econ/Hands-On-Econ/tree/master/Lent/

To begin open the 'Michaelmas' folder above and then open the file 'Week 1. Course Overview and Preliminaries.ipynb'. Everything else will get explained there!
