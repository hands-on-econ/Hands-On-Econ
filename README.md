# Getting Started

Hands-On Econ is hosted on Github, an extremely useful platform used mostly for software development. Don't worry though, we're not developing any software here! We're just using Github to host files which make up the course. This is the only Github page we have to worry about so we'll move on to explain what exactly these 'files' we're hosting are. The course is formatted as 'Jupyter Notebooks' with the .ipynb extension. These files are used because they are much more versatile than either just text files (.doc) or just Python/R files (.py/.r). Jupyter Notebooks (or 'notebooks') contain all of the code, all of the output from the code and all of the explanation for each week. They are essentially the entire course!! Github is just *hosting* the course. We *access* the course through a dedicated platform for opening notebooks: NBViewer.

To begin open the 'Michaelmas' folder above and then open the file 'Week 1. Course Overview and Preliminaries.ipynb'. Everything else will get explained there!
