    "It should be apparent by this point in your studies that data is essential to economics. Rather than give a pointless list of all the areas of economics which use data it's probably more helpful to think of examples which don't. Among these could be things like the Prisoner's dilemma game, or the Bertrand model of competition. Obviously many people would certainly still argue these examples use data in some way, or took data to create but the key point we need to note is that economics can be more or less split into two 'domains': **theory and empirical work**. It might be something of a surprise that micro and macro isn't the split, or academic and private-sector. These are valid splits too but for this course it's more helpful if we consider the theory/empirics split. \n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretical economics comprises all the models which economics use to help them understand the world. No serious economists actually 'believe' their models, they simply use them as frameworks to conceptualise a very specific part of the world. Theory is awesome and essential for all economists but what we're concerned with in this course is empirics. Empirical work in economics is essentially application of theory, or trying to use evidence to test the predictions theories make about the world. This is the kind of economics we're going to learn tools to do in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what kind of data do empirical economists use in their research? **All sorts of stuff!** Of course all the usual things like prices, interest rates and market values are used with expected regularity but there are plenty of types of data which might not typically be associated with economics despite them being used fairly regularly too. For example a labour economist might want to make sure they're controlling for how busy a neighbourhood is, so they could use traffic data in a regression. A development economist might want to make sure they're comparing potential crop outputs across similar regions, so they might use soil fertility data or geological data. Economics is even starting to see things like text and images used as data, for example to assess central bankers' speeches or the effectiveness of advertising! What do economists do with this data? Regression is the most obvious answer, but also things like modelling and forecasting. We can break down the most common types of data into a few categories, which we'll do below.\n"

    "The kinds of data which interest economists can be grouped in many different ways but one particularly useful way is to group them by source. Hopefully you've heard of cross-sectional and panel-data by now but what may not be clear is what exactly are generating these cross-sections and panels. There are a few key things:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first main source of data is **survey data**. This is pretty self-explanatory and involves units of observation (people, firms etc) answering questions posed to them by researchers. Some students are quick to dismiss surveys as not 'hard' enough evidence, and commonly associate them with subjective questions. This isn't at all the case! Surveys can be used to come with predictions of inflation by polling leading economists for example, or to analyse bussiness sentiment by polling business leaders. Surveys also give us data on 'expectations' which are an essential part of economics. They're not without their flaws but surveys are an extremely important form of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second main source is **national accounts data**. This comprises (often government) estimates of indicators like GDP, inflation and other mostly macro data. It is the kind of data most people associate with economics and is essential to lots of applied work. One important characteristic of national accounts data is its 'level of aggregation', or the level of observation for which we can get information. For example a dataset which shows us GDP for each year in England is more aggregated (and probably less useful) than a dataset which shows us GDP for each month in England, and this is more aggregated (and again probably less useful) than a dataset which shows us GDP for each county in England for each month. In general economists want as disaggregated data as they can get because they can always combine observations and aggregate back up themselves if they want to. The most disaggregated or 'granular' data is called 'microdata' and is usually reserved for professional researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third main source of data is **company data**. Publicly-listed companies are required by law to release reports to the public on a regular basis, the specifics of which vary across jurisdictions. As a result there are many third-party companies which provide databases containing readily formatted repositories of all the data these companies have released over a period of time, usually many decades. In addition to this market data is also widely available. This includes variables like a listed company's share price, P/E ratio and other statistics of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth main kind is sort of everything else. Examples of other key sources of data could be data from experiments which economists conducted themselves or data from legal cases which had been processed into a dataset. Other sources could be variations on the above categories, like local government data or business industry group data. In addition to this we've already covered some of the 'alternative' types of data like geological data but there really isn't much of a limit to what could potentially be useful. That's for the economist to decide!\n"

    "So now that we've got a sense of why data is useful and what processes usually generate it the natural next step is to figure out where to go looking for it. Sticking with our previous classification we'll do a brief tour of the most useful places to look for data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Survey data is probably the hardest kind to access. Good quality survey datasets can often be restricted due to privacy concerns or simply to the organisation's internal researchers. In the UK the best source is the UK Data Service https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk:\n",
