# How to use Github

Github is an extremely useful file-sharing platform which we use to host the files for Hands-On Econ. The course is contained within the Michaelmas and Lent folders seen above and is formatted as 'Jupyter Notebooks' with the .ipynb extenssion. These files are used because they are much more versatile than either just text files (.doc) or just Python/R files (.py/.r). Jupyter notebooks contain all of the code and all of the explanation for each week and are essentially the entire course. 

Github *can* open notebooks but it is **extremely unreliable** so for the best results we **highly recommend** copying the url of each notebook and pasting it at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org, which is a dedicated platform for opening Jupyter Notebooks.
