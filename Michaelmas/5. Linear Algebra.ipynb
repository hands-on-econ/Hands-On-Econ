    "Anyone who has ever used Microsoft Excel has some understanding of a **matrix**. Ok, that's not quite true, but we're not too far from the truth either. Anyone who has ever used Microsoft Excel *with only numbers in each cell* has some understanding of a matrix. What about **vectors**? Well anyone who has ever used a column in Microsoft Excel *with only numbers in each cell* has some understanding of a vector. Not so sure? We'll lets look at some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "$V=\\pmatrix{1  \\cr 2  \\cr 3 \\cr}$ is an example of a vector with dimensions $3 \\times 1$ and $M=\\pmatrix{1 & 2  \\cr 4 & 5   \\cr 7 & 8  \\cr}$ is an example of a matrix with dimensions $3 \\times 2$ (the $n \\times k$ notation refers to the number of rows of a matrix/vector followed by the number of columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first obvious question is why is V a vector but M is a matrix? Well the answer is that vectors are any array with dimension $n \\times 1$, so they essentially form a *column*, like a column in excel. What about M? Well M is just a collection of columns in a sense, so because it has more than one column it is called a matrix. Matricies (the plural of matrix) come in all shapes and sizes, as we'll see in the next section. Matricies are going to get a lot more of our love and attention for the next little while but don't forget about vectors. In the section after next (<a href='#Vector Spaces'>Vector Spaces</a>) they're going to be extremely important.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I guess the last key thing we need to cover here is ***who cares about matricies***?? One answer: economists. When we do econometrics we use data to try to find trends in an economy. Very often this data will be structured as observations and variables. Observations are the things providing us with our data. They could be countries, people, counties, businesses and loads of other things. Variables are the information they are providing us with. If people responding to a survey declare their income this would be stored under a variable named 'Income'. Countries produce statistics on their inflation levels, each of which could be stored in a variable named 'Inflation'. There are countless examples of these kind of observation/variable combinations, and very often this is how the data we use in econometrics is structured. Hopefully the excel example is starting to make more sense.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix algebra is so key because in econometrics we need to be able to multiply whole rows, columns and datasets to find coefficients which help us understand trends in the data. None of this is done by hand, but without understanding why R, Stata, SAS or any other software gives us the result it does it is crucial we understand what is going on under the hood. After all, lots of this software is so easy to use that a smart 10 year old could run it. It takes Linear Algebra to understand why it works, how to fix it when it breaks and all the traps that we can easily fall into without noticing. So with that out of the way, let's get started.\n",

Let's have a better look at what does and doesn't hold and when.\n",

    "A heads up about the rest of this notebook: a lot of these concepts are a bit scary-sounding (WTH is an Eigenvector??). Vector spaces may sound scary too but the good news is that in a sense you are reading this on one. That's right, any 2-D object can be thought of as a part of the vector space $\\mathbb{R}^2$. How? Well every point on the 2-D object, let's use this screen for example, can be thought of as a pair of an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate. Because of this, these coordinates can be written as a $2\\times1$ vector $\\pmatrix{x \\cr y}$. All that the vector spaces are is the mathematical concept behind what we already know as actual space! If this kind of makes sense then hopefully you won't be too shocked to hear that if you look up from your screen and start looking around then you'll be staring at a part of the vector space $\\mathbb{R}^3$, because every coordinate of your room/library/wherever can be thought of as a $3\\times1$ vector $\\pmatrix{x \\cr y \\cr z}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, let me be clear about something: your laptop screen isn't *actually* a part of the vector space $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and your room isn't *actually* a part of $\\mathbb{R}^3$. They're just analogies. But the reason we use them is that they're extremely useful in getting us to think about what vectors actually are. This is especially useful because if we understand $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\\mathbb{R}^3$ well enough then we can start thinking about $\\mathbb{R}^4$, $\\mathbb{R}^5$ and $\\mathbb{R}^n$, where n could be any whole number (one billion dimensions, anyone?). Clearly any value of n larger than 3 does not accomodate a visual analogy but the maths continues in the exact same way. What's more, if we want to do econometrics then every observation in our sample will get its own dimension, so 17,732 people in a survey means we need to be comfortable working with the vector space $\\mathbb{R}^{17732}$. This might sound impossible now, but if we get a solid understanding of what vector spaces are then this will be pretty managable - one day even easy!\n",
    "\n",
    "So what do we actually mean when we say vector space? Well to start with a vector space is a set. Sets are just collections of objects and we introduced them back in the notebook 'Important Distributions I'. So vector spaces are sets, but they're special sets. They're special because they satisfy two extremely important properties: **closure** under **pointwise addition** and closure under **scalar multiplication**. Closure means that the result of our operation *stays in* the set. So for example the set of all the positive whole numbers 1, 2, 3 etc (AKA natural numbers) is closed under addition because for any two positive whole numbers like 2 and 3, when we add them together we get a third (5) which is still a positive whole number! The set of the positive 'half' numbers $\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{5}{2} $etc are *not* closed under addition because clearly $\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{3}{2}=2$ and 2 isn't a 'half number'.\n",
    "\n",
    "This same idea extends to our vector spaces. In a vector space, say $\\mathbb{R}^3$, *any* vector added to *any* other vector gives us a third vector which will still be in the vector space. For example $\\pmatrix{1 \\cr 1 \\cr 1}+\\pmatrix{2 \\cr 2 \\cr 2}=\\pmatrix{3 \\cr 3 \\cr 3}$, and $\\pmatrix{3 \\cr 3 \\cr 3}$ is in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (because it is a vector of dimension $3\\times1$ with real entries)! When we say pointwise addition we simply mean addition like we defined it for matricies in the last section. \n",
    "\n",
    "The same concept applies to scalar multiplication. Scalar multiplication is just multiplying a vector by a constant (a scalar), which could be any real (non-imaginary) number. So $5\\times \\pmatrix{1 \\cr 1 \\cr 1}$ is a valid form of scalar multiplication, which gives the result $\\pmatrix{5 \\cr 5 \\cr 5}$ - a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're wondering when we're going to start using R in this section then sit tight - we're building up the questions and ideas which R make *much much* easier to deal with than using pen and paper. Back to vector spaces. The reason vector spaces are so important is because vectors are so important, and the reason vectors are so important is because matricies are so important. Matricies are just collections of vectors, because each column in a matrix of dimension $n\\times k$ is a vector of dimension $n\\times 1$. A really important question in linear algebra is whether any of the columns/vectors in a matrix are linear combinations of other columns/vectors. By linear combinations we mean just that: a combination which is linear. So the vector $\\pmatrix{1 \\cr 2}$ is a linear combination of $\\pmatrix{1 \\cr 0}$ and $\\pmatrix{0 \\cr 1}$ because $\\pmatrix{1 \\cr 0}+2\\pmatrix{0 \\cr 1}= \\pmatrix{1 \\cr 2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this is so important is a little abstract but it's essentially about 'new information'. We're trying to figure out if we add a new column to our matrix do we get any new information or did we already know what is being added. Let's take an econometric example: say we add the distance in miles of the respondent's commutes to our regression. If we knew nothing about their commute before we did this then we could be adding new information which could help us draw conclusions about the sample. But if we already knew the distance of their commutes in kilometres then we've learned nothing! That's because one mile is approximately 1.6 kilometres, so our column/vector/variable 'Commute in Miles', which could look like:  $\\pmatrix{13.53\\cr 43.3\\cr1.4\\cr9.32\\cr\\vdots \\cr 0}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "is just $1.6$ times our column/vector/variable 'Commute in Kilometres', or $1.6 \\times \\pmatrix{8.45\\cr 27.06\\cr0.87\\cr9.32\\cr\\vdots \\cr 0}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What has this got to do with vector spaces? Three things: **basis**, **rank** and **span**. A basis of a vector space is any set of vectors such that any other vector in the vector space can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors. It should be pretty easy to see that in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ the vectors $\\pmatrix{1 \\cr 0},\\pmatrix{0 \\cr 1}$ do the job, because any vector in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ (say $\\pmatrix{23 \\cr 4}$) can be written as a linear combination of $\\pmatrix{1 \\cr 0},\\pmatrix{0 \\cr 1}$ (in this case   $23\\times\\pmatrix{1 \\cr 0},4\\times\\pmatrix{0 \\cr 1}$). So $\\pmatrix{1 \\cr 0},\\pmatrix{0 \\cr 1}$ form a basis of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Likewise in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, $\\pmatrix{1 \\cr 0\\cr 0},\\pmatrix{0 \\cr 1\\cr 0},\\pmatrix{0 \\cr 0\\cr 1}$ form a valid basis, and in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, so do the vectors $\\pmatrix{1 \\cr 0 \\cr \\vdots \\cr 0},\\pmatrix{0 \\cr 1 \\cr \\vdots \\cr 0},...,\\pmatrix{0 \\cr 0 \\cr \\vdots \\cr 1}$ (there are n of these).\n",
    "\n",
    "The key thing to note here is that these aren't the *only* possible bases (plural of basis) for these vector spaces. The reason that they are is that they can't be written as linear combinations of each other. There is no real number $\\alpha$ such that $\\alpha \\times \\pmatrix{1 \\cr 0}=\\pmatrix{0 \\cr 1}$, and there are no real numbers $\\beta \\text{ and } \\gamma$ such that $\\pmatrix{1 \\cr 0\\cr 0}=\\beta\\pmatrix{0 \\cr 1\\cr 0}+\\gamma\\pmatrix{0 \\cr 0\\cr 1}$. We say that vectors which are like this are called **linearly independent**. So if we want to find a basis of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ all we need to do is find n vectors which are linearly independent. The easiest way to do that is to find n vectors of the form $\\pmatrix{1 \\cr 0 \\cr \\vdots \\cr 0},\\pmatrix{0 \\cr 1 \\cr \\vdots \\cr 0},...,\\pmatrix{0 \\cr 0 \\cr \\vdots \\cr 1}$, which have the special name the 'standard basis vectors'.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about rank?\n",
    "\n",
    "The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent columns/vectors it contains. So the matrix $\\pmatrix{1 &0& 0 \\cr 0 & 1 & 0\\cr 0 & 0 &1}$ (which is just the matrix of the vectors $\\pmatrix{1 \\cr 0\\cr 0}, \\pmatrix{0 \\cr 1\\cr 0}, \\pmatrix{0 \\cr 0\\cr 1}$) has rank 3, because it has 3 linearly independent columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix $\\pmatrix{1 &0& 0 & 0 & 2 & 4 & 0 & 5 &1 & 4 & 0 &5\\cr 0 & 1 &0 & 4 & 4 &1 7 & 3 &11 & 8 & 6 &1 & 7\\cr 0 & 0 &1 & 4 & 0 &5 &7 &5 &2 &4 &4 &1}$ can only have rank 3 because it contains the standard basis vectors, so the rest of the columns/vectors can't be linearly independent!\n",
    "\n",
    "It is extremely tedious to find the rank of a matrix with pen and paper, so this where R helps us a lot. Take the matrix $\\pmatrix{ 3&  1 \\cr   5& 4  \\cr}$. R finds it rank much faster than we can!"

    "The second concept is the transpose of a matrix. Transposition is essentially changing all of the rows of a matrix into columns and all of the columns into rows. The rows and columns both keep their position, so the 1st row is the 1st column, the 2nd row the 2nd column etc. Unlike inversion, any matrix of any dimensions (including vectors) can be transposed. For example: $\\pmatrix{ 3&  4& 5 \\cr   3& 2 &6 \\cr 9 &  6 &  5\\cr}^{ T}= \\pmatrix{ 3&  3& 9 \\cr   4& 2 &6 \\cr 5 &  6 &  5\\cr}$  and $\\pmatrix{ 3  \\cr   3 \\cr 9   \\cr}^{ T}= \\pmatrix{ 3&  3& 9 \\cr}$\n",

    "$M^{-1}M$$=I_n $. In order to find this matrix $M^{-1}$ we must take the transpose of the matrix of cofactors (which we introduced in the last section) which gives us the **adjoint** matrix. Then we multiply the adjoint matrix by $\\dfrac{1}{det(M)}$ to find the inverse. This final step should show us why non-singularity is a crucial condition. If our matrix were singular it would have a determinant of 0, so we couldn't multiply the adjoint matrix by $\\dfrac{1}{det(M)}$\n",

    "The last essential topic we need to cover before we can dive into our first econometrics notebook (at last) is how to differentiate (we don't cover integration here) matricies. Differentiating a function of a vector of variables like $f(x)=f(\\pmatrix{x_1 \\cr x_2 \\cr  \\vdots \\cr x_n})$ may seem ridiculously complex but its actually not so bad if we just think about what we're doing.\n",
