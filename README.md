# Getting Started

Hands-On Econ is hosted on Github, an extremely useful platform used mostly for software development. Don't worry though, we're not developing any software here! We're just using Github to host files which make up the course. This is the only Github page we have to worry about so we'll move on to explain what exactly these 'files' we're hosting are. The course is formatted as 'Jupyter Notebooks' with the .ipynb extension. These files are used because they are much more versatile than either just text files (.doc) or just Python/R files (.py/.r). Jupyter Notebooks (or 'notebooks') contain all of the code, all of the output from the code and all of the explanation for each week. They are essentially the entire course!! Github is just *hosting* the course. We *access* the course through a dedicated platform for opening notebooks: nbviewer. 

Below are the two links to each term's content on nbviewer. If they look exactly like the two folders above then that's because they are. The only reason we use nbviewer and the links below to access the course and not Github and the links above is that Github is really good at *hosting* notebooks and really bad at *displaying* them. You're welcome to try and open the files contained in the folders above (they're exactly the same as the ones on nbviewer below) but don't be surprised if you get errors like "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?", or if graphs/text/symbols/code don't load properly. 

# The Course (on nbviewer)

Michaelmas: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hands-on-econ/Hands-On-Econ/tree/master/Michaelmas/

Lent: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hands-on-econ/Hands-On-Econ/tree/master/Lent/

To begin open the link to the nbviewer 'Michaelmas' folder above and then in nbviewer open the file 'Week 1. Course Overview and Preliminaries.ipynb'. Everything else will get explained there!

We hope you enjoy the course!
