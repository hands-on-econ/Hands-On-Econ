# Getting Started

Hands-On Econ is hosted on Github, an extremely useful file-sharing platform. Github can seem a little scary to start with so here's a brief guide to using it for Hands-On Econ. The course is contained within the Michaelmas (term 1) and Lent (term 2) folders seen above and is formatted as 'Jupyter Notebooks' with the .ipynb extension. These files are used because they are much more versatile than either just text files (.doc) or just Python/R files (.py/.r). Jupyter Notebooks (or 'notebooks') contain all of the code, all of the output from the code and all of the explanation for each week. They are essentially the entire course!!

Github *can* open notebooks but it is **extremely unreliable**. Common errors include 'Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?' and code/graphics/formatting/text failing to load or loading *extremely slowly*. For the best results we **highly recommend** copying the url of each notebook and pasting it at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org, which is a dedicated platform for opening notebooks.

To begin open the 'Michaelmas' folder above and then open the file 'Week 1. Course Overview and Preliminaries.ipynb'. Don't worry about waiting for it to load, just go to the url at the top of your browser, copy it and paste it at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org. Everything else will get explained there! 

All queries and comments should be directed to handsonecon@gmail.com

We hope you enjoy the course!
