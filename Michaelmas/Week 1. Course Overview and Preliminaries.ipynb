    "# Course Overview and Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Hands-On Econ, a student-run course aimed at giving LSE students who've completed or are enrolled in ST102, MA100 and EC220/EC221 the tools to do economics in R and Python. If you're not from LSE or you haven't completed these courses then don't worry - you're still very welcome to use these materials. Just don't been too surprised if you find the content challenging or the structure of the course confusing. It's been set up *by* **quantitative LSE students** *for* **quantitative LSE students**. This overview is structured as a Q&A to get the most obvious questions answered and give you a sense of what's to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is it\n",
    "\n",
    "Hands-On Econ is a course trying to bridge the gap between all the cool stuff you've been taught at LSE so far and the technology which lets you apply that to solve problems. LSE does a very good job of teaching the theory and practice of maths and economcics (and many other things) but it's all too common for students to get so caught up in learning this content that they **miss the forest for the trees**. Being able to find the eigenvalues of a $12343642\\times 12343642$ matrix might seem kind of useless, even if you can do it in 2 minutes in R, but in this course you'll see why it actually might be really useful to know how to do something like that (spoiler: regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "The course itself is made up of files like the one your reading now called 'Jupyter notebooks' and an hour-per-week lunchtime session which will take place on campus. Each Sunday evening that week's notebook will get released in time for you to have a look over it before the lunchtime session. It's completely fine if you don't want to come to all of these sessions, and it's completely fine if you don't want to come to any! But we think that **people learn better together** and that learning this stuff can actually be really fun when you're learning it with others. Also, what better way to meet like-minded people?!? Totally your call but we'd love to have you.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're running the course as two terms, Michaelmas and Lent, for obvious reasons. The first term is based around the R language, which we will teach from scratch. If you can already code pretty well in R then the first week may be a little tedious for you but just make sure you're up to speed by the time we get to week 2 because **no one likes falling behind**. After that we'll do an overview/refresher of some stats and linear algebra. Hopefully around this point you'll start to see that the Bernoulli distribution really *isn't* that scary, and some other cool stuff. The rest of the term will be about doing econometrics. Metrics is really cool part of economics which doesn't get enough love for how useful it is. Hopefully once you've learned to load your own data into R, plot histograms and scatterplots, find coefficients, do t and F-tests and make your own regresssion tables you'll see how useful it can be too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second term will be based around teaching you Python, which is kind of R's more general purpose cousin. This **isn't a course in computer science** so don't worry, we won't go into the differences between scripting languages and programming languages or what Object-Oriented Programming is. We're really just about getting practical skills to use these two awesome tools for a range of stuff. In Lent we'll start with a from-scratch introduction to Python and then a week on how to do some of the stuff from Michaelmas in Python. From week 3 we start with Machine Learning and from week 6 we start with creating economic models using the (awesome) QuantEcon package. The last few weeks are currently being left blank so we can figure out what most interests you. Some options are web-scraping, creating web-apps, pivot tables and advanced visualisation, but this part of the course is still TBA.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why should I care?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is probably the most important question here. The answer is really short: **to learn to code!** Many of you reading this probably already can do lots of cool things in Java, C++, Python etc. but we're pretty sure that there's more of you that can't. If you can't code and you want to learn then this course is 100% for you. If you can't code and you don't know if you should learn then here's our pitch: apart from it being a huge asset on your CV and in work generally, coding is just kind of cool! Coding is a way of **making something**, whether that's a cool visualisation, a program which scrapes all the tweets about Kylie Jenner or a regression which finds evidence for an interesting economic phenomenon. If you can already code then I'm sure it's easy to get bored with what might seem like pretty remedial content; but seriously give this course a chance. Once again this isn't a course in computer science, or maths, or economics, or anything particularly theoretical. It's essentially just a course to give you practical tools which can make life easier and more interesting. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I'm way too busy for this!\n",
    "\n",
    "We know what internships are. We know what firsts are. We know what a full courseload at LSE looks like. It's not our place to be telling you what your priorities should be. All we can say is to make the time for this course you feel it deserves. But it's also crucial to point out that this course is **designed to help** you along the paths a lot of LSE students tend to take. Anyway, we'll leave that with you - so no hard feelings if you have to stop coming.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### There's quite a lot of content here, has it been checked by professors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yep! LSE's own have taken the time to make sure everything written here is bona fide legit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### My friend at UCL/Cambridge/Fudan would love this! Can I send it to her?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course. The more the merrier.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is it going to be hard?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorry but yes, definitely yes. We're talking about learning **new skills**, solidifying old content (which may or may not have been crammed in May and June) and applying this knowledge to real-world problems. Of course it's going to be hard! But that comes with two caveats. The first is it's not going to be **dry** (we hope...). This course is packed with *loads* of examples, simulations, visualisations and learning aids to make life way easier for you. There's still a lot you have to do on your own to make it click but we've done everything to can to make sure all things irrelevant and tedious have been left out. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing is that we're only really asking for **5 hours a week** - *including* the lunchtime session. That might seem like a lot but we seriously think that's enough to take you from no coding experience to Machine Learning in an academic year. Obviously this number is just a guide. If it's clicking and you're spending exactly 0 hours a week learning it at home then good on you, but we'd just advise you to make sure you can *replicate* the stuff taught here and not that it just doesn't sound like Esperanto to you (unless of course you speak Esperanto, in which case we hope it sounds like Esperanto to you). Likewise if you're spending 2 hours a day, every day, and it's still not clicking fully then we'd say maybe working smarter could be your friend. The past notebooks will always be available so check back over them to make sure you've got the fundamentals right and maybe even go back over your maths notes from early university to make sure that's down pat too. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### I'm a super-keen first-year/politics student/non-LSE student, do you think I'm going to be out of my depth?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's totally your call. All of this stuff has been designed for a specific kind of student but that doesn't mean it's only relevant to them. The main advice we'd offer is have a go, don't get down if you're struggling and make sure to check out all the other great resources on the web (Khan Academy especially if your high-school maths is a little rusty) too. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is it free?\n",
    "\n",
    "Love, kindness, seashells and all other major currencies are accepted. Also no one would hold it against you if you felt like bringing donuts. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How do I sign up?\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't! Just come along!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Who are you people and why are you doing this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning is cool and teaching is even cooler. Every point we've made here has forced us to understand this content better than we ever could just by coming to lectures or reading stuff on Github. Also similar kinds of courses were around when we were coming through LSE so this is our chance to do it our way! We all go to LSE and were in a similar position to you a few years ago so don't feel scared about saying hi if you see us around. \n",
